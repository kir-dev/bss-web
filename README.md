# BSS website

This is the repository for the BSS website. The website is built using React and TypeScript by [Kir-Dev](https://kir-dev.hu).

To start development run `yarn install` and then `yarn dev`.

## React + TypeScript + Vite

Created with the React + TypeScript + Vite template.

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
